seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the 
Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is 
being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little 
thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven 
hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have 
access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your 
miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution 
your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you 
couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will 
drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. """
